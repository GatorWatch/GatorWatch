CIS4930: Dialogue Systems Project
Fall 2017

### Dev Team:
+ Tim Mai
+ Stanley Tan
+ Hugh Wu


### Description
This project will allow users to communicate with a system to find information about 
movies and TV shows. Users can look up media and find the associated information 
such as the description, show times, and related media that might fit the user's interests.

The objective of this project is reduce the frustration that comes with looking for
available movies and TV shows. The project will gather information from the web according
to the user's requests and present the information to the user. The hassle in looking for
any media would be reduced. Libraries will also be used to implement the dialogue system aspect
of the project.

Note: The project will only encompass movies and TV shows that are not part of streaming services
(e.g. movies and shows from Netflix and Amazon will not be included).
